      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>Our aim for the prototype was to make sure we emphasized on sense of completion and on simplicity. Since our app requires a lot of confirmation screens and communication, we found it crucial that the user receives a lot of feedback when they are
        going from screen to screen creating drives/rides. In order to represent the completion of actions, we used alerts for the user to confirm. We have a lot of confirmation screens so that the user can double check their info to prevent mistakes.
        We also emphasized on simplicity where the layout from page to page is very minimalist. We decided to use the Tree Drill Down JQuery feature in order to represent the existing rides. This way, we could make searching less text intensive for the
        user and more interactive.</p>
